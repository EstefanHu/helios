        <p>
          First and foremost, you own what you create. Any original content you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise
          provide to Helios remains yours and is protected by copyright and any other applicable intellectual property
          laws.

          technical requirements of networks, devices, services, or media, and this license includes the rights to do
          so. For example, we may need to modify your story to make sure it is viewable on an iPhone as well as a
          computer.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.list}>
          Public Posts: If you share a Post with other users on Helios, then you grant us the license above, as well as

          to access the Post, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of Helios.
        </p>

        <h2>Terminating Your Account</h2>

        <p>
          Helios is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of Helios, or your account, for any reason at our
          discretion. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are
          able to retrieve any important Posts you may have uploaded to your account, but we may not do so if we
          determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone&lsquo;s safety or security, or
          otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Helios.
        </p>

        <p>
          Helios also allows you to delete your account at any time.{' '}
          <b>If you&lsquo;d like to delete your account, you can do so from your account page.</b> When you delete your
          account, any Posts associated with that account will also be deleted. However, any Post that you have made
          public may remain available.
        </p>

        <p>
          You understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete your content from Helios&lsquo;s
          records or backups, and that your Posts may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or
          stored by other users. Please refer to our <Link href='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</Link> to understand how we
          treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using Helios.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that some of the obligations in these Terms will be in force even after you terminate your account.
          All of the following terms will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any
          limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, terms regarding
          disputes between us, and any other terms that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms.

        <p>
          We&lsquo;re always trying to improve Helios, so our products and services may change over time. We may suspend
          or discontinue any part of Helios, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or
          restrict access to parts or all of Helios. We&lsquo;ll try to give you notice when we make a material change
          to Helios that would adversely affect you, but this isn&lsquo;t always possible or practical.

        <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>

        <p>
          We are constantly trying to improve our products and services, so these Terms may need to change along with
          Helios. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention
          by placing a notice on the website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don&lsquo;t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will
          no longer be able to use Helios. If you use Helios in any way after a change to the Terms is effective and
          notice has been provided, that means you agree to all of the changes.

        <p>
          Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be

          Failure to follow any of these Terms shall constitute a breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate

          restrictions set forth in these Terms.

      <div className={styles.legalSection}>
        <h2>Miscellaneous Terms</h2>

        <p>
          The above covers most of the questions that we typically receive about Helios. We have grouped provisions that
          come up less frequently below:
        </p>

        <p className={styles.list}>
          Indemnification: To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Helios, its
          affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims,
          liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys&lsquo; fees) arising
          from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of Helios (including any actions
          taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a
          claim, suit, or action, we will attempt to provide notice to the contact information we have for your account
          (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations
          hereunder).
        </p>

        <p className={styles.list}>
          Assignment: You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or
          your Helios account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without our prior written consent. We may
          transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.list}>
          Choice of Law: These Terms are governed by and will be construed under applicable federal law and the laws of
          the State of Washington, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.list}>
          Arbitration and Class Action Waiver: Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
          shall be finally settled by arbitration in King County, Washington, in accordance with the Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) then
          in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and
          commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in
          accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered
          may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial
          acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you
          and Helios shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or
          other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of these Terms, you
          consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, King
          County, Washington, or the Seattle District of Washington. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding
          arising out of these Terms will be entitled to an award of costs and attorneys&lsquo; fees. To the fullest
          extent permitted by law, you and Helios Inc agree that all claims against the other can only be brought in an
          individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or other
